# 
# | type      |  condition_2 |
# |--------------------------|
# | cortical  |  correction  |
# | motor     |  correction  |
# | cortical  |  mutant      |
# | motor     |  mutant      |

# AVG_FPKM_GROUP = list(c('type','condition_2'),c('type'))
#
# This will generate an average fpkm for all combinations of each the variables 
# in each vector resulting in 6 columns, i.e.:
# cortical_correction_avg_fpkm, cortical_mutant_avg_fpkm, motor_correction_avg_fpkm, 
# motor_mutant_avg_fpkm, cortical_avg_fpkm, motor_avg_fpkm

# The ~misassignment_samples_filter will be used in dplyr::filter to find out reference samples for the estimation.

# For example,
# "AMCon", "cells=='NA' & treatment=='Con'", "human,mouse",
# This row specify that, for the rat sample with condition 'AMCon',
# we will use the human/mouse samples to estimate the misassign precentage.
